# Description
This project ([go to Kaggle for interactivity](#)) focuses on [Dynamic Model SEIR](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-020-05743-y) (Susceptible Exposed Infected Recovered) to model the epidemic spread such as COVID-19. I explored how different variables affect the spread of the epidemic. I also explored the effect of various modelling techniques, namely [Discrete Time Modelling](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Scientific_Computing_Simulations_and_Modeling/Introduction_to_the_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_(Sayama)/04%3A_DiscreteTime_Models_I__Modeling/401%3A_DiscreteTime_Models_with_Difference_Equations), [Continuous Time Modelling](https://math.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Scientific_Computing_Simulations_and_Modeling/Introduction_to_the_Modeling_and_Analysis_of_Complex_Systems_(Sayama)/06%3A_ContinuousTime_Models_I__Modeling#:~:text=Continuous%E2%88%92time%20models%20are%20written,place%20smoothly%20over%20continuous%20time.), and (ochastic Modelling)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process]. Finally, I performed a [Steady State Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady_state) using [Cobwebbing](https://ms.mcmaster.ca/~clemene/1LS3lectureoutlines/1ls3_3.2.pdf), [Phase Plane Analysis](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-30-estimation-and-control-of-aerospace-systems-spring-2004/0b318c74f4b1ae41dc4393e39b9cab17_ch3_nnl.pdf), and the Dynamic of Long Time Horizon.

## Use cases:
### 1. Epidemiological Forecasting and Decision Support
The SEIR model, combined with discrete, continuous, and stochastic time modelling, provides a powerful tool for predicting the course of an epidemic, such as COVID-19. These models enable public health officials and policymakers to simulate different scenarios, assess potential outcomes, and make informed decisions about interventions like vaccination campaigns, social distancing, and quarantine measures.

### 2. Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis
Exploring how different variables (e.g., transmission rates, recovery rates) affect epidemic dynamics allows for sensitivity analysis, helping identify the most critical factors in disease spread. This analysis is crucial for optimizing intervention strategies and ensuring that resources are directed where they will have the most significant impact.

### 3. Uncertainty Management and Risk Assessment
Stochastic modelling captures the randomness and uncertainty inherent in real-world epidemics, particularly in small populations or during early outbreak stages. This approach is vital for risk assessment, helping to quantify uncertainties and prepare for a range of possible outcomes, thus enhancing the robustness of epidemic response strategies.

### 4. Long-Term Public Health Planning
Steady-state analysis, including Cobwebbing, phase plane analysis, and long-time horizon dynamics, offers insights into the long-term behaviour of an epidemic. Understanding whether a disease will die out, persist, or become endemic allows for better long-term planning and resource allocation, ensuring that public health strategies remain effective over time.
